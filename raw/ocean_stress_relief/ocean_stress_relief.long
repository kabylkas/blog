Working on the Ph.D. can be pretty stressful time to time: constant deadlines, results that don't align with the hypothesis, debugging, etc. I strongly believe that having this kind of places around the school is crucial (see video).

I fell in love with the ocean. A constant periodic sound of waves and occasional screams of seagulls simply hypnotize me. It puts me into the state of peace and calmness.

The eyes can't fully grasp the size. Every single time the brain gets shocked! It tries hard to fathom how enormous the ocean is, which leads to a conclusion of my insignificance in this world. Not to mention my problems that I keep thinking about all the time. All of a sudden, my "huge" problems turn into dust. Dust that gets spirited away with the chilly and salty ocean breeze.
