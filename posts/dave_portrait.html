Every day I pass by these portraits that hang on the walls of our headquarter office in Mountain View. At first sight, it seems like an ordinary picture, doesn't it? But it is not that simple... In fact, I believe these are the most bad-ass portraits I have ever seen! The reason I am so fascinated by this is that the whole picture is the zoomed-in physical layout of the CRISP microprocessor. Those faces are drawn within the circuitry. So if you would want to actually see them in the implementation, you would need a powerful microscope!<br><br>

CRISP was first produced in 1987 by AT&T Bell Labs. It was a general purpose processor. According to their paper, it had 170 thousand transistors fabricated in 1.75u CMOS technology and ran at 16 MHz clock. Laughable numbers compared to today's machines ðŸ˜ƒ These days we talk about billions of transistors, nanometer technology node, and gigahertz. Nonetheless, CRISP and its successor Hobbit are always present in the microprocessor history due to its elegant design and innovations. It was used in EO Personal Communicator which was competing with Apple's Newton. Those two are ancestors of today's tablets if you've never heard about them ðŸ˜Š <br><br>

The people on the portraits are the engineers who designed CRISP. The guy on the very left is Dave Ditzel, CEO of Esperanto Technology and my current boss. He is a very well known person in Computer Architecture community and I am kind of proud to know him in person. Super smart, caring, leader are only a few words that describe him... But more about Dave and the company in the upcoming posts ðŸ˜Š <br>
